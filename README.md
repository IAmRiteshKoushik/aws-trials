# AWS Trials
This repository contains the code written during experimentation with various 
Amazon services through writing `Node-express` backend code.

## Serverless - AWS Lambda
This module involved getting introduced to AWS Lambda and how we can deploy 
serverless functions for our backend application. While it is not fully 
suitable for running an entire backend, it can handle certain particular 
tasks and would be a good technology to consider when building and API with 
less number of end-points. (maybe 2-3)

For more extended end-points, you would considering establishing the elaborate
API gateway and then linking AWS Lambda functions to it. (required exploration)
