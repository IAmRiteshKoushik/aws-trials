# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Whenever we are workigng with any cloud provider we are in need of a place
for `object-storage`. We might need to store different kinds of multi-media 
assets like videos, images etc.

## How does s3 work ?

- In an AWS account you can have only upto 100 buckets
- Bucket sizes do not have an official limit. Object size limit is set to 
5TB maximum.
- Every type of data is supported in this storage service.
- s3 bucket names are globally unique (like usernames and domain names)
This is because for accessing objects within the bucket, AWS generates unique 
domain names. For example :
```
Bucket Name : riteshkoushikdev
Item Stored : ProfilePhoto.jpeg
URL : https://riteshkoushikdev.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ProfilePhoto.jpeg

(Will not be accessible if public access is denied)
```
- By default buckets are extremely secure because they have blocks on 
  public access.
- However if you give public access that is not enough to access the 
  objects stored inside the bucket. You need something called as bucket policy.
- Basically, you need to define read/write and other access to the public as 
  bucket policies.

> NOTE : One does not remember bucket policies, just refer the docs.

- Bucket versioning is a VCS for buckets. (This does add to your cost)
- You can directly upload files to s3
- You can create folders on the s3 online console.
- The filepath : "/path/to/file" is what we call as `key`
